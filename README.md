This is my graduation project from the ASP.NET Core course. It is also my first personal project.

It is in the form of a game. In it you start with one hero and you increase your power by buying items and beating other heroes for leveling up. 

My controller tests are not working properly. I tried mocking the database, checked google and used several ways to make them work, but I wasn't able to. I still have a few that are working, but I don't know if it will be enough.
